# ðŸ“Š Sales Performance & Incentive Dashboard

This project is an end-to-end solution developed to digitize and analyze sales management processes.

# Project Detail

As part of a sample sales performance project, I developed a comprehensive end-to-end solution focused on data analytics and visualization using Python. I began by designing a system that generated random data, producing four different CSV files and one JSON file.

On this data, I implemented:

Functional metrics for sales performance and market share analysis,

Customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis,

Predictive modeling of sales trends through selected regression models and comparison of their performance.


To present these analyses in a user-friendly and interactive way, I built a centralized dashboard using the Streamlit library, enabling clear and dynamic data visualization.

This project stands out as a fully functional data science application where I independently managed the entire processâ€”from data generation to analysis and final presentation.
